# 🖐️ Sign Spotting System  
[GitHub Link](#)

## 📝 Overview  
This project focuses on enhancing **sign language recognition**, specifically **British Sign Language (BSL)**, through **deep learning**. Using **transfer learning** on an **I3D model (Inflated 3D ConvNet)** originally trained on video data, we adapted it for BSL to capture complex **spatial-temporal patterns** essential for **real-time recognition**.

## 🔑 Key Components  

1. **I3D Model**:  
   A **3D CNN architecture** fine-tuned on BSL data to capture gestures across time, essential for sign language’s **unique movement dynamics**.

2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   The **I3D model** extracts meaningful **spatial-temporal features**, enabling the system to **differentiate intricate sign motions**.

3. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**:  
   - This **classifier** processes I3D features to recognize specific signs within the video.  
   - It aids in **mapping extracted features** to **predicted sign classes**.

4. **Temporal Analysis**:  
   Designed for **real-time scenarios** by analyzing **continuous video streams**, the system detects and identifies signs in real-time, enabling seamless interaction with **ongoing video inputs**.

## 🛠️ Challenges and Optimizations  

- **Transfer Learning**:  
   Fine-tuning the pre-trained I3D model with **BSL data** significantly **improves accuracy**, reducing both **training time** and **data requirements**.

- **Handling Signer Variability**:  
   - Trained on videos from **diverse signers** and settings, the system generalizes across users.
   - This approach **reduces retraining costs** and improves the model’s **adaptability**.

- **Domain Adaptation**:  
   - This strategy enhances recognition performance and **minimizes the need for extensive retraining**.

## 🎯 Impact & Applications  

1. **Accessibility**:  
   Facilitates **real-time sign recognition**, aiding communication for the **deaf and hard-of-hearing community**.

2. **Automatic Annotation**:  
   Automates **manual labeling** of sign data, reducing time and **research costs**.

3. **Potential for Translation**:  
   Can integrate with **NLP models** for **sign-to-text/speech translation** to further expand its usage.

## 📊 System Architecture
The system consists of multiple interconnected modules:

1. Feature Processing:
Extracts relevant features from input video using I3D and temporal models.
2. Encoder-Decoder Model:
Encodes features for learning dependencies across frames and decodes them to predict output signs.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Expanding to Other Sign Languages (e.g., ASL or ISL)
- Integrating Voice Commands for a hybrid communication system
- Mobile Deployment for better accessibility
